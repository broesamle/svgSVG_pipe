=====================

**Inject svg content into existing SVG documents (keeping their structure).**

Graphics applications are often picky (extremely picky) about the formatting of graphics documents. In order to have SVG files interpreted by your/everybodies favourite vector graphics application, the file structure not only needs to follow the SVG specs, but should follow a precise structure of layers, ids, and other unwritten conventions.

The project wants to facilitate such import/export processes in graphics-intense workflows that involve

 + automated SVG generation (e.g. for data visualisation)
 + inject/extract SVG content into/from existing XML/SVG/HTML documents
 + smooth integration with interactive vector graphics/CAD applications
 + automated data-import and visualisation into complex pre-formatted graphics documents
